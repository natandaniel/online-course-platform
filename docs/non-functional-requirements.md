# Non-Functional Requirements

## Availability & Reliability
- **Uptime Target:** The system should maintain at least 99.9% uptime per month.
- **Redundancy:** Critical components (web servers, application servers, databases) must have redundancy and automatic failover mechanisms.
- **Backup & Recovery:** Regular backups should be taken and tested to ensure minimal data loss (RPO) and fast recovery times (RTO).

## Scalability & Performance
- **Concurrent Users:** The platform should support a high number of concurrent users (e.g., 10,000 or more) with acceptable performance.
- **Response Times:** API endpoints, especially critical ones, should respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Horizontal Scalability:** The architecture must support horizontal scaling (e.g., through containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes).

## Security
- **Encryption:** All communications must use HTTPS/TLS. Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details) must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Use robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT) and enforce role-based access control.
- **Compliance:** Ensure the system meets applicable regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR for data privacy, PCI-DSS for payment processing).
- **Vulnerability Management:** Regular security audits, penetration testing, and timely patching of vulnerabilities.

## Maintainability & Extensibility
- **Modular Architecture:** Code should be organized with clear separation of concerns (e.g., domain logic, API layer, data access).
- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for code, architecture, and deployment procedures.
- **Extensibility:** The system should be designed to allow easy addition of new features or integration with third-party services without major refactoring.

## Monitoring & Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Implement detailed logging for application events, errors, and user activities.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Utilize tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time performance monitoring and alerting.
- **Log Retention:** Logs should be retained for a sufficient period (e.g., 30-90 days) to support troubleshooting and audits.

## Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Containerization:** The system should be containerized using Docker to ensure consistency across environments.
- **Orchestration:** Use an orchestration platform like Kubernetes for scalable deployment and management.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate testing, building, and deployment processes with a robust CI/CD pipeline.
- **Environment Separation:** Clearly distinguish between development, staging, and production environments.

## Usability & Accessibility
- **Intuitive UI:** The user interface should be intuitive and designed with user experience in mind.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the platform is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to support users with disabilities.
- **Usability Testing:** Conduct regular usability tests to validate that the system meets user needs and expectations.

## Data Integrity & Consistency
- **Transactional Integrity:** Ensure that operations, especially those involving payments and enrollments, are ACID-compliant.
- **Database Consistency:** Implement constraints and validations to maintain data integrity across all interactions.
- **Regular Audits:** Perform regular data integrity audits to identify and rectify any inconsistencies.

## Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity
- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Establish and document a disaster recovery plan with defined RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).
- **Regular Testing:** Conduct periodic disaster recovery drills to ensure preparedness for unexpected events.
- **Redundancy:** Leverage multi-region or multi-availability zone deployments to minimize the impact of localized failures.
