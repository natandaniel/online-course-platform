# Testing & Quality Assurance

## 1. Testing Strategy

The platform should undergo multiple levels of testing to ensure reliability, security, and usability. The testing strategy includes:

- **Unit Testing**: Ensures individual components function correctly.
- **Integration Testing**: Validates interactions between different modules (e.g., API calls, database queries).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Simulates real user flows (e.g., course enrollment, payment processing).
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluates system responsiveness under load.
- **Security Testing**: Identifies vulnerabilities in authentication, authorization, and data handling.

## 2. Unit Testing

- **Objective**: Validate that individual methods and components work as expected.
- **Tools**: JUnit, Mockito, Spring Boot Test.
- **Scope**:
    - Business logic (e.g., enrollment rules, payment validation).
    - Controllers and services (testing request/response handling).
    - Utility methods (e.g., email generation, date formatting).

## 3. Integration Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure seamless interaction between application modules.
- **Tools**: Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers (for database-dependent tests).
- **Scope**:
    - API endpoints (e.g., verifying correct HTTP responses).
    - Database interactions (e.g., saving and retrieving user enrollments).
    - External services (e.g., mock Stripe API calls).

## 4. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Objective**: Simulate user interactions from frontend to backend.
- **Tools**: Selenium, Cypress, Postman (for API testing).
- **Scope**:
    - User registration, login, and authentication.
    - Course search, enrollment, and payment processing.
    - Progress tracking, notifications, and certificate issuance.

## 5. Performance Testing

- **Objective**: Assess system behavior under various loads.
- **Tools**: JMeter, Gatling, Locust.
- **Scope**:
    - Stress testing (handling peak loads).
    - Load testing (scalability evaluation).
    - Response time benchmarking.

## 6. Security Testing

- **Objective**: Identify vulnerabilities in authentication, access control, and data security.
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
- **Scope**:
    - SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF attack prevention.
    - Role-based access control verification.
    - API endpoint security evaluation.

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Testing

- **Objective**: Automate testing as part of continuous integration and deployment.
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins.
- **Scope**:
    - Run unit tests before merging code.
    - Execute integration tests post-deployment.
    - Perform security scans before production release.

## 8. Manual Testing & Usability Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure the user experience meets expectations.
- **Scope**:
    - UI responsiveness and navigation checks.
    - Accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG).
    - Functional validation of core features.

## 9. Bug Tracking & Issue Management

- **Objective**: Maintain a structured approach to tracking and resolving issues.
- **Tools**: Jira, Trello, GitHub Issues.
- **Scope**:
    - Log and categorize reported bugs.
    - Prioritize critical fixes.
    - Track regression testing efforts.

## 10. Test Data & Environments

- **Test Data Management**:
    - Use anonymized sample user and course data.
    - Seed test databases with realistic content.
- **Testing Environments**:
    - **Local Development**: Dockerized services for fast iteration.
    - **Staging Environment**: Pre-production validation before releases.
    - **Production Monitoring**: Real-time logging and alerting.

## Summary

The testing strategy ensures that the platform is functional, performant, secure, and user-friendly before deployment. Automated and manual testing work together to maintain high software quality across all aspects of the system.
