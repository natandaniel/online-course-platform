# Documentation Strategy

## 1. Overview

Comprehensive documentation is essential for maintainability, onboarding, and scaling the platform efficiently. This section outlines the documentation strategy for different aspects of the system.

## 2. Types of Documentation

### **1. Developer Documentation**
**Purpose**: Helps developers understand the system architecture, APIs, and deployment processes.

- **Code Documentation**
    - Inline documentation using Javadoc for Java classes and methods.
    - API endpoints documented using **SpringDoc OpenAPI** (Swagger UI).
    - Annotations for key domain models and database entities.

- **API Documentation**
    - Automatically generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
    - Includes **request parameters, response formats, and authentication details**.
    - Hosted as part of the application (e.g., `/api/docs`).

- **Deployment Guides**
    - How to set up and run the platform locally using **Docker Compose & Minikube**.
    - CI/CD pipeline configurations.
    - Kubernetes deployment instructions.

---

### **2. User Documentation**
**Purpose**: Helps students and admins use the platform effectively.

- **Student User Guide**
    - How to register, enroll in courses, and track progress.
    - Payment processing and refund policies (if applicable).
    - How to submit and track support tickets.

- **Admin Guide**
    - Managing users, courses, and announcements.
    - Handling support tickets and monitoring the system.
    - Managing tax policies and platform configurations.

---

### **3. API Reference Documentation**
**Purpose**: Provides a structured reference for consuming the platformâ€™s REST APIs.

- **Tools Used:** OpenAPI (Swagger UI), Postman Collections.
- **Contents:**
    - Authentication and token usage.
    - CRUD operations for courses, enrollments, payments.
    - Webhook support (e.g., Stripe notifications).
    - Pagination, filtering, and sorting guidelines.

---

### **4. System Architecture Documentation**
**Purpose**: Describes the high-level architecture, components, and interactions.

- **Architecture Overview**
    - Diagram of system components (frontend, backend, database, messaging, API Gateway).
    - Explanation of microservices (if applicable).

- **Database Schema Documentation**
    - ER diagram for PostgreSQL database.
    - Table relationships and constraints.

- **Event Flow Documentation**
    - Sequence diagrams for major flows (e.g., user registration, payment processing).
    - Kafka event topics (if used).

---

### **5. Security & Compliance Documentation**
**Purpose**: Documents security policies, best practices, and compliance standards.

- **Authentication & Authorization**
    - JWT-based security.
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) policies.

- **Data Protection**
    - Encryption standards (TLS, AES for sensitive data).
    - Data retention and backup policies.

- **Regulatory Compliance**
    - GDPR compliance for user data protection.
    - PCI-DSS compliance for payment security.

---

## 3. Documentation Hosting & Accessibility

- **GitHub Wiki / Markdown Files**
    - All documentation stored in a `docs/` folder within the project repository.
    - Markdown files for quick access (`docs/API.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, etc.).

- **Swagger UI (API Docs)**
    - Hosted on `/api/docs` as an interactive reference.
    - Automatically updated when APIs change.

- **Confluence / Notion (Optional)**
    - Internal documentation for team collaboration.

---

## 4. Documentation Maintenance

- **Versioning**
    - Documentation should match API versions (e.g., `v1`, `v2`).
    - Deprecated features should be marked clearly.

- **Automation**
    - API documentation should regenerate with each deployment.
    - CI/CD pipeline should validate that documentation is up-to-date.

---

## Summary

A structured and well-maintained documentation strategy ensures **developers, users, and administrators** can effectively understand, use, and maintain the platform. With auto-generated API references, markdown-based guides, and architecture diagrams, the system remains **transparent and scalable**.
