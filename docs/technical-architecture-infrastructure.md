# Technical Architecture & Infrastructure

## Technical Architecture Overview
- The platform is built using a microservices-based architecture where the frontend and backend are decoupled.
- Clients (web and/or mobile) interact with the backend via REST APIs.
- Core business logic is implemented using Java and Spring Boot, with domain aggregates managing key functionalities.
- Data is persisted in PostgreSQL.
- External integrations (e.g., payment processing with Stripe) and optional messaging (via Kafka) enable secure and scalable operations.

## Tech Stack & Justification

- **Programming Language & Framework:**
  - **Java & Spring Boot:** Robust and scalable; supports rapid development, strong community support, and enterprise-grade features.
- **Database:**
  - **PostgreSQL:** Reliable relational database with advanced features; suitable for handling complex queries and ensuring data integrity.
- **Frontend:**
  - **Modern JavaScript Framework (React/Angular/Vue):** For building an engaging, responsive, and dynamic user interface.
- **Containerization & Orchestration:**
  - **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
  - **Minikube (For Local Testing):** Lightweight Kubernetes cluster to test deployment configurations locally before pushing to a cloud environment.
  - **Kubernetes (For Production):** Facilitates horizontal scaling and resilient deployment of microservices.
- **Payment Integration:**
  - **Stripe:** Provides secure, globally compliant, and feature-rich payment processing.
- **Messaging & Event Processing:**
  - **Kafka (Optional):** Enables decoupled, asynchronous handling of domain events (e.g., user registration, enrollment, payment events) for scalability and resilience.
- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - **Prometheus & Grafana:** For real-time monitoring, performance metrics, and alerting.
  - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** For centralized logging and analysis.
- **CI/CD & DevOps:**
  - **GitHub Actions or Jenkins:** For automated building, testing, and deployment.
- **Security:**
  - **Spring Security & JWT:** For robust authentication, authorization, and secure API access.
  
## Infrastructure and Deployment

- **Environment Management:**
  - Separate environments for development, staging, and production to ensure smooth transitions and testing.
- **Deployment Strategy:**
  - **Local Development:**
    - Use **Docker Compose** for quick setup and iteration.
    - Use **Minikube** to test Kubernetes deployments locally before pushing to cloud-based clusters.
  - **Production:**
    - Use **Kubernetes** (EKS on AWS, AKS on Azure, or GKE on GCP) for orchestrating microservices in a scalable manner.
- **Cloud Considerations:**
  - Use local emulation tools (like **Azurite**) during development for cloud storage testing.
  - In production, leverage cloud services (AWS, Azure, or GCP) for hosting, storage, and managed infrastructure.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Implement automated pipelines to run tests, build Docker images, and deploy services seamlessly.
- **Disaster Recovery & Backups:**
  - Regular backups of databases and critical data.
  - A documented disaster recovery plan with defined Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

## Integration & Communication

- **API Gateway (Optional):**
  - Use an API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway) for centralized routing, authentication, and load balancing.
- **Inter-Service Communication:**
  - Use **REST** for synchronous communication between services.
  - Optionally, use **Kafka** to process domain events asynchronously, decoupling core business operations from notification or audit logging processes.
