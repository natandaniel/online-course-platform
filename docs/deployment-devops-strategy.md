# Deployment & DevOps Strategy

## 1. Deployment Approach

The platform will follow a **containerized deployment** strategy using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and consistency across environments.

- **Local Development**:
    - Uses **Docker Compose** to run services (backend, database, message broker).
    - **Minikube** to test Kubernetes manifests before cloud deployment.

- **Staging Environment**:
    - A pre-production environment mimicking the production setup.
    - Automated deployment triggered via CI/CD pipelines.
    - Used for **QA testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).**

- **Production Environment**:
    - Runs on **Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, or GKE)** for high availability and auto-scaling.
    - Uses **Load Balancers** and **Auto-Scaling Groups** for optimal traffic handling.
    - **Blue-Green Deployment** to reduce downtime when releasing new versions.

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline

### **Tools Used:**
- **GitHub Actions / Jenkins**: Automates build, test, and deployment steps.
- **Docker**: Containerizes application components.
- **Kubernetes + Helm (Optional)**: Manages deployments in a cloud environment.

### **Pipeline Workflow**
1. **Code Commit & Versioning**
    - Developers push changes to GitHub (main & feature branches).
    - Pull requests trigger automated test suites.

2. **Build & Test**
    - CI/CD runs **unit, integration, and security tests**.
    - Builds Docker images for backend and frontend.

3. **Artifact Storage**
    - Successful builds are pushed to **Docker Hub / AWS ECR / Azure ACR**.

4. **Staging Deployment**
    - Deployed on **staging Kubernetes cluster** for testing.
    - UAT and performance testing conducted before approval.

5. **Production Deployment**
    - Blue-Green deployment minimizes downtime.
    - Rollbacks enabled for failed deployments.

## 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Terraform / Pulumi**: Automates provisioning of cloud resources.
- **Helm Charts**: Manages Kubernetes deployments.

---

## 4. Logging & Monitoring

### **Tools Used:**
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Collects real-time system metrics.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Centralized logging for debugging.
- **Jaeger / OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing for microservices.

### **Monitoring Goals:**
- Detect performance issues and API failures.
- Track usage patterns and load spikes.
- Alert admins on system failures (Slack/Webhook alerts).

---

## 5. Security & Compliance

- **Data Encryption**:
    - Use **TLS (HTTPS)** for secure API communication.
    - Encrypt database storage with **PostgreSQL Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**.

- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**:
    - **Spring Security + JWT** for authentication.
    - **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** for admin & student permissions.

- **Automated Security Scans**:
    - Use **OWASP ZAP / SonarQube** to scan for vulnerabilities.
    - Regular **dependency audits** to patch security risks.

---

## 6. Disaster Recovery & Backup Plan

- **Automated Backups**:
    - Daily snapshots of the **PostgreSQL database**.
    - Backup storage in **AWS S3 / Azure Blob Storage**.

- **Failover Strategy**:
    - Multi-region deployment for high availability.
    - Auto-recovery scripts to restart crashed services.

- **Recovery Objectives**:
    - **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** < 15 minutes.
    - **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** < 1 hour.

---

## 7. Scaling Strategy

- **Horizontal Scaling**:
    - **Auto-scaling in Kubernetes** (pods scale dynamically based on CPU/memory).
    - **Message Queues (Kafka)** to decouple services for improved performance.

- **Database Scaling**:
    - **Read replicas for PostgreSQL** to distribute query load.
    - Use of **connection pooling** to optimize DB requests.

---

## 8. Cost Optimization

- **Cloud Cost Management**:
    - **Use reserved instances / spot instances** for reduced pricing.
    - **Optimize container resources** to avoid unnecessary spending.

- **Serverless Considerations (Optional)**:
    - Some components (e.g., notifications, background jobs) can be offloaded to **AWS Lambda / Azure Functions** for cost efficiency.

---

## Summary

The deployment and DevOps strategy focuses on **automation, security, and scalability**, ensuring a smooth development workflow and robust system reliability. With containerized applications, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and disaster recovery plans in place, the platform is **ready for scalable production deployment**.
